The goal of schex is to provide easy plotting of hexagon cell
representations of single cell data stored in `SingleCellExperiment` or
`Seurat` objects.

## Installation

You can install schex using the [Bioconductor
project](https://bioconductor.org/):

``` r
# install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("schex")
```

You can install the development version of schex with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SaskiaFreytag/schex")
```

Note that you may need to install several Bioconductor packages if you
havenâ€™t done so manually.

``` r
# install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version='devel')
BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")
```

## Why you need schex?

Did you know that order in which points are plotted depends on their
location in the data frame? For example when plotting the expression of
CD19, a B-cell maker, you may get the following three plots depending on
how you order your observations.

![Observations in decreasing order with regrads to their CD19
expression](man/figures/figure-html/ggplot-decreasing-1.png)
![Observations in increasing order with regrads to their CD19
expression](man/figures/figure-html/ggplot-increasing-1.png)
![Observation in random
order](man/figures/figure-html/ggplot-random-1.png)

Using the first plot you would not decide to call the central cluster a
B-cell population. Using the second plot you would probably decide to
call the same cluster a B-cell population. Using the last plot you might
be undecided.

## The solution

Instead of plotting points on top of each other, schex summarizes points
into hexagon cells. Hence avoiding confusion due to observation order.
