The goal of schex is to provide easy plotting of hexagon cell representations
of single cell data stored in `SingleCellExperiment` or `Seurat` objects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of schex with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SaskiaFreytag/schex")
```

## Why you need schex?

Did you know that order in which points are plotted depends on their location
in the data frame? 
For example when plotting the expression of CD19, a B-cell maker, you may 
get the following three plots depending on how you order your observations.

![Observations in decreasing order with regrads to their CD19 expression](misc/example_schex_files/figure-html/ggplot-decreasing-1.png){width=49%}
![Observations in increasing order with regrads to their CD19 expression](misc/example_schex_files/figure-html/ggplot-increasing-1.png){width=49%}
![Observation in random order](misc/example_schex_files/figure-html/ggplot-random-1.png){width=49%}

Using the first plot you would not decide to call the central cluster a B-cell 
population. Using the second plot you would probably decide to call the same 
cluster a B-cell population. Using the last plot you might be undecided.

## The solution

Instead of plotting points on top of each other, schex summarizes points into 
hexagon cells. Hence avoiding confusion due to observation order.
