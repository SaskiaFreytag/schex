\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}}
or \code{\link[Seurat]{Seurat-class}} object.}

\item{col}{A string referring to the name of one column in the meta data of
sce by which to compare. Note this factor can only contain two levels.}

\item{mod}{A string referring to the name of one column in the meta data of
sce by which to compare. Note this factor can only contain two levels.}

\item{type}{A string referring to the name of one column in the meta data of
sce by which to compare. Note this factor can only contain two levels.}

\item{feature}{A string referring to the name of one feature.}

\item{title}{A string containing the title of the plot.}

\item{xlab}{A string containing the title of the x axis.}

\item{ylab}{A string containing the title of the y axis.}

\item{colors}{A vector of strings specifying which colors to use for plotting
the different levels in the selected column of the meta data.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{ggplot2}{ggplot}} object.

\description{
Plot of fold change of selected gene in single cell data using 
   bivariate hexagon cells.
}
\details{
This function plots fold change within each 
  hexagon, which are calculated with \code{\link{make_hexbin}}. 
  Note that the fold change is only accurate if the condition 
  investigated is within the same individual. For conditions across 
  different individuals different methods that account for 
  individual-specific effects are required.
