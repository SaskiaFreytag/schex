plot_hexbin_interact(
  sce,

  type,
  feature,
  interact,
  title = NULL,
  xlab = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}}
or \code{\link[Seurat]{Seurat-class}} object.}

\item{mod}{A vector of strings referring to the names of the modularities.
For \code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}} use "RNA" to
access the RNA expression data stored as the main experiment type.}

\item{type}{A vector of strings referring to the types of assays in the
\code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}} or the types of
transformation in \code{\link[Seurat]{Seurat-class}} object.}

\item{feature}{A vector of strings referring to the names of one features in
the same order as the vector of modularities.}

\item{interact}{A string specifying how interaction between features is
calculated. Possible interaction measures are
\code{corr_spearman} and \code{mi} (see details).}

\item{title}{A string containing the title of the plot.}

\item{xlab}{A string containing the title of the x axis.}

\item{ylab}{A string containing the title of the y axis.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{ggplot2}{ggplot}} object.
}
\description{
Plot of interaction of expression of single cells in bivariate hexagon cells.
}
\details{
This function plots the interaction between any features in the
   hexagon cell representation calculated with \code{\link{make_hexbin}}. The
   interaction between the chosen features is calculated by one of two
   measurers \code{corr_spearman}, \code{ratio} and \code{mi}:

   \describe{
      \item{\code{mi}}{Returns the mutual information coefficient.}
      \item{\code{corr_spearman}}{Returns the Spearman correlation.}
      \item{\code{fc}}{Return the log fold change between the features.}
   }
   
   Note that \code{fc} should be applied to log normalized values.
